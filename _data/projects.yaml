Trust is fundamental to our digital interactions, when all of which take place between pseudodyms and email addresses that are not necessarily grounded in physical identities.<br/><br/>A multi-component platform was used to trial the machine learning technology, and engage with potential users to understand the effect the technology had on trusting individuals online. The platform comprised of browser extension, command line tools, user portals, combined with multiple backend microservices for the machine learning and DLT infrastructure.'
